# GCP-Pipeline
 CI/CD pipeline for deploying cloud functions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
 Create a new Cloud Function in GCP, and write the code for the function.

Create a new Cloud Source Repositories repository for your cloud function. You can use Git or any other version control system.

Create a new Cloud Build trigger for your repository. The trigger should be set to build on any changes to the repository.

Create a new cloudbuild.yaml file in the root directory of your repository. This file will define the steps for the build process. Here's an example cloudbuild.yaml file:
Replace <your-function-name>, <your-function-entry-point>, and <your-function-runtime> with the appropriate values for your cloud function.

In the Cloud Build trigger settings, add a build step that runs the cloudbuild.yaml file. This will build and deploy your cloud function whenever changes are made to your repository.

Set up automated tests to ensure that your cloud function is functioning correctly after deployment. You can use tools such as Selenium or Robot Framework to perform functional tests, and tools such as JMeter or Gatling to perform load testing.

Set up continuous monitoring and alerting for your cloud function. You can use GCP's Stackdriver monitoring tool or other monitoring tools such as Prometheus or Grafana to monitor the performance and availability of your cloud function.

Finally, make sure to follow best practices for security and compliance when deploying cloud functions, such as using encrypted secrets and maintaining audit logs.
